        """Log a completed set (workoutlog). Without a date, wger stamps the
        entry with the current time; a bare date lands at 12:00.

        weight_unit is 'kg' or 'lb'. The weight is stored in the unit given, so
        a trainee who works in pounds gets pounds back out, with no rounding
        drift from converting twice.

        reps_unit says what `reps` counts: repetitions (wger's default),
        seconds, minutes, meters, kilometers, miles, until_failure or max_reps.
        A plank logged without it is stored as 60 repetitions rather than 60
        seconds, which no later reading of the log can undo.

        rir records Reps In Reserve for the set: how many good repetitions were
        left. It is how wger tracks set effort. rest is the pause after the set,
        in seconds. A trainee often reports a range — "maybe 3 or 4" — and the
        field takes one number: record the LOWER bound. It is the claim they
        are sure of, and it is the conservative one for deciding load. Do not
        average the range or invent a value between its ends.

        weight is required, so a bodyweight set is weight=0. That is wger's own
        convention for unloaded work, not a missing value.

        This tool always INSERTS. To revise a set already written — a corrected
        rep count, a better RiR — call update_workout_log with the id this call
        returned, in the `id` field of its result. Calling log_set again writes
        a second row for the same physical set, and nothing downstream can tell
        the pair apart from two genuine sets at the same load.

        exercise_id is the movement ACTUALLY PERFORMED, which is not always the
        one the plan names. When a machine is occupied or a gym lacks the
        equipment, pass the substitute's own exercise_id and still point
        routine_id, slot_entry_id and iteration at the planned slot: the set
        stays attached to the plan and the history stays true to what was
        lifted. Reusing the slot's planned exercise_id for a substitute files a
        rope pushdown as a machine pushdown, and no later reading of the log can
        tell the two apart. search_exercises finds the substitute's id.

        routine_id, slot_entry_id and iteration attach the set to the plan it
        was performed from; get those three from get_workout_for_date. Its
        planned entries carry an exercise_id too, but that one is the movement
        PLANNED — pass it only when it is also the one performed, and pass the
        substitute's own id when it is not. Without them the set is still
        logged and still counts towards the exercise's history, but it is
        freestanding work: wger reads a routine's log view and its statistics
        through the routine link, so an unattached set is invisible there and
        in the apps that show a plan's progress.

        The *_target fields record what was prescribed next to what was done, in
        the same row: reps_target, weight_target, rir_target, rest_target.
        get_workout_for_date supplies the prescribed numbers, so pass them along
        with the ids and "did I hit the program" is answerable from the log
        alone, without re-reading the plan as it stands later.

        session_id attaches the set to a workout session (see
        list_workout_sessions); wger opens one for the day if none is given.
        next_log_id chains this set to the next log of a dropset series.
