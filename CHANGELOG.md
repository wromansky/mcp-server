# Changelog

Changes to the wger REST API itself are documented in the backend's release
notes. This file records important changes to *this package*.

## Unreleased

* `get_workout_for_date` returns the day's `description` as `day_description`.
  A routine's per-day notes are where rep ranges, machine substitutions and
  form cues live, and the tool that answers "what am I doing today" was
  returning the planned numbers without the terms they were written under — a
  caller reporting the plan quoted a bare rep count where the routine had
  specified a range. Unset descriptions come back as `null`, matching
  `day_name`.
* `log_set` and `add_exercise_with_sets` take their default weight unit from
  the trainee's own wger profile instead of a hardcoded `kg`. A profile set to
  pounds now records pounds when the caller omits `weight_unit`; before, a
  trainee reporting "225" had it stored as 225 kg, wrong by a factor of 2.2 and
  indistinguishable downstream because the number is plausible either way. An
  explicit `weight_unit` still wins, and an unreadable profile falls back to
  `kg`, so nothing fails on a transient profile error.
* `add_exercise_with_sets` takes an optional `max_reps`, so a planned set can
  record a rep RANGE rather than a single number. Without it, "3 x 8-12" had to
  be stored as `8` and the top lived only in the conversation; a trainee whose
  progression rule is "add weight once you beat the top of the range" had no
  stored top to beat. `max_reps` below `reps` is refused before anything is
  written, since `reps` is the bottom of the range. The `max_reps` config kind
  already existed for `set_slot_entry_config`; this reaches it from the
  high-level authoring call.
* `attach_exercise_to_slot` and `update_slot_entry` accept a unit NAME for
  `repetition_unit` and `weight_unit` — any of the names `log_set` already took
  — as well as wger's numeric id. Before, these were the only unit fields in the
  server that took a bare integer with no mapping, so a caller had to know that
  seconds is 3; `log_set` has always taken names. A wrong id is invisible
  afterwards: a 30-second hold written with id 2 is stored as "30 until
  failure", and nothing in the record says it was meant to be time. On these two
  tools numeric ids still pass through unchanged, whether sent as a number or as
  a string like `"3"`, and an unknown name is refused before the write instead
  of reaching wger. Elsewhere — `log_set`, `update_workout_log`,
  `set_slot_entry_config`, `add_exercise_with_sets` — the unit parameters are
  typed `str` and have never taken a number, so a number stays refused there.
* Unit names are matched case- and space-insensitively everywhere, so wger's own
  display names ('Seconds', 'Until Failure') are accepted alongside the fixture
  names.
* The unit lists in `log_set`'s docstring and in the README are reordered to
  match wger's actual ids and now say to pass the name rather than infer a
  number from the list's order. As written before, they listed seconds second
  while seconds is id 3 and `until_failure` is id 2, so a reader counting
  positions arrived at exactly the wrong value. The docstrings of the two
  slot-entry tools, which do take an id, now state every id outright.

## 0.2.0

* `add_exercise_with_sets` returns the created ids, as its docstring always
  said, instead of the full serialised slot, slot-entry and config objects.
  Measured over a real routine build: 29 calls returned 62,878 characters,
  38.7% of every tool result in the session, for what a caller uses as three
  ids. Partial-failure diagnostics (`stage`, `slot_rolled_back`, the API error
  body) are unchanged, since those are the fields a caller actually reads.

* The routine tools split into `routines_read` (9 tools) and `routines_write`
  (16), selectable separately through `MCP_TOOLS`. The authoring half is ~4.2k
  tokens of schema — nearly a quarter of the whole surface — that an agent
  following an existing plan never calls. `routines` stays valid and still
  means both halves, so existing configuration is unaffected; tool names do not
  change either way.
* README documents `MCP_TOOLS` profiles with measured token costs, and says
  what the full surface costs so the trade is visible rather than guessed at.
* `log_set` and `update_workout_log` reach the rest of wger's log fields:
  `reps_unit` (a plank was stored as 60 repetitions, not 60 seconds),
  `rest`, the `*_target` counterparts of reps/weight/rir/rest, `session_id`
  and `next_log_id` for dropset chains. `update_workout_log` additionally
  takes `exercise_id` and the plan linkage, so a set logged against the wrong
  exercise or with no routine can be corrected instead of re-entered.
* New tool group `workout_sessions` (5 tools): wger opened a session for every
  logged set, but its own fields — date, notes, `impression`, start and end
  time — had no tool to read or write them.
* Progressions can be gated on the logs: `set_slot_entry_config` and
  `update_slot_entry_config` take `requirements`, wger's rule list over
  `repetitions`, `weight`, `rir` and `rest`. Without it every progression fired
  on schedule whether or not the trainee earned it.
* Slot entries take `entry_type` (warmup, dropset, myo, …) and the
  `repetition_rounding` / `weight_rounding` fields, so a warmup is no longer
  planned as a working set and a percentage step no longer prescribes weights
  no bar can hold.
* RiR arguments now match wger's own rule — half steps up to 4.5
  (`RIR_OPTIONS`), on logs, on `add_exercise_with_sets` and on the `rir` /
  `max_rir` configs. The previous bound of 10 let through values wger's model
  validator rejects, so the caller spent a round trip on a 400 instead of
  being told which values exist.
* Routines take `is_template` / `is_public`, days take `need_logs_to_advance`,
  and `update_slot` / `update_slot_entry` can move a slot to another day or an
  entry to another slot.
* `add_exercise_with_sets` deletes the slot it created when the exercise cannot
  be attached to it. Such a slot holds no exercise, renders in no plan view and
  is listed by no routine tool, so a caller could not find it to clean it up. If
  the cleanup delete fails as well, the response still carries the slot id and
  reports `slot_rolled_back: false`.
* `log_set` can attach a set to the plan it was performed from, via the new
  `routine_id`, `slot_entry_id` and `iteration` arguments. Logs written without
  them are freestanding: wger reads a routine's log view and its statistics
  through that link, so an unattached set is invisible there and in the apps
  that show a plan's progress.
* New tool `get_workout_for_date`: what a routine prescribes on a given date,
  one entry per planned set, with the exercise name and the ids `log_set`
  needs. Reading the same thing by walking days, slots, entries and configs
  costs dozens of requests.

## 0.1.0

* First release on PyPI: `pip install wger-mcp` / `uvx wger-mcp` instead of needing a git checkout.
